## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Chris, an AI Master's student from Austria, who loves to code and experiment!

Here are some of my repos and projects that I am particularly proud of! âœ¨

#### Research repos ðŸ¤“
- [Adv-MultVAE](https://github.com/CPJKU/adv-multvae) accompanies our [SIGIR'22 paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531820) "Unlearning Protected User Attributes
in Recommendations with Adversarial Training", for which I have written most of the code.
- [Recommender Metrics](https://github.com/Tigxy/recommender-metrics) implements all recommender metrics that we use in our paper above to quantify our results.
- [SiBrar - Single-Branch Recommender](https://github.com/Tigxy/SiBraR---Single-Branch-Recommender) accompanies our RecSys'24 paper "A Multimodal Single-Branch Embedding Network for Recommendation in Cold-Start and Missing Modality Scenarios".

#### Personal projects / tools ðŸ§°
- [WinShortcut](https://github.com/Tigxy/WinShortcut), my favorite developer tool to define shortcuts on Windows. If you are also working on Windows, be sure to check it out!
- [PyCalc](https://github.com/Tigxy/PyCalc), a little side-project, which taught me how to properly (and safely ðŸ˜‰) evaluate equations specified as strings.
- [Pomodoro](https://github.com/Tigxy/Pomodoro), following the famous Pomodoro technique for studying. Useful for any student ðŸ˜„.

Feel free to browse through all my other repositories, and see, if anything sparks your interests! ðŸ˜†

I am happy to connect on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/christian-ganhoer/)! ðŸ¤—
