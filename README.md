## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Chris, an AI Master's student from Austria, who loves to code and experiment!

Here are some of my projects that I am particularly proud of! âœ¨

#### Research repositories ðŸ¤“
- [Adv-MultVAE](https://github.com/CPJKU/adv-multvae) accompanies our "Unlearning Protected User Attributes
in Recommendations with Adversarial Training" paper, for which I have written most of the code.
- [Recommender Metrics](https://github.com/Tigxy/recommender-metrics) implements all recommender metrics that we use in our paper above to quantify our results.

#### Personal projects / tools ðŸ§°
- [WinShortcut](https://github.com/Tigxy/WinShortcut), my favorite developer tool to define shortcuts on Windows. If you are also working on Windows, be sure to check it out!
- [PyCalc](https://github.com/Tigxy/PyCalc), a small little side-project of mine, which taught me how to properly (and safely ðŸ˜‰) evaluate equations specified as strings.
- [Pomodoro](https://github.com/Tigxy/Pomodoro), following the famous Pomodoro technique for studying. Useful for any student ðŸ˜„.

Feel free to browse through all my other repositories, and see, if anything sparks your interests! ðŸ˜†

I am happy to connect on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/christian-ganhoer/)! ðŸ¤—
